      <p> You walk into the room. The darkness creeps up to you, swallowing you whole, but then, you see two small red lights. Curious, you walk up, reaching out to it. But then, you stop midway. It looks a bit strange. You stand there, staring carefully. Then you see it. The two red lights blinking once. Those were someone's eyes. Or something... <br> You turn back, running as hard as you can, and you almost reach the door, but something grabs your arm hard, and pulls you in back into the darkness. <br> "No! Help! Anyone!" You scream. <br> Filled with terror, you pass out. You wake up the next morning, in your room, on your bed. <br> "Was it all a dream? Huh" You wonder. "Phew. Thank god."    </p>
